Instructions:

Define a TypeScript interface for the returned user object

Write a function fetchUsers that uses fetch or any other suitable method to retrieve user data from the given URL.

Implement the following operations using the fetched user data:

1. Print the details of the user with the highest id.
2. Display the names of users whose address contains the word "Suite" in any form (case-insensitive).
